**Doc** is code, can do everything !

## markdown will be a "standard"

(word, excel, powerpoint, axure, sketch, wiki, yuque)

**Monorepo** is good !

---

**Each extra dependency doubles the complexity**

<top>Plugin System</top>

- Core Design
- Core Plugins

## [babel told us](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)

- Single lint, build, test and release process.
- Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
- Single place to report issues.
- Easier to setup a development environment.
- Tests across modules are run together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules easier.

---

**Functional programming** is good !
